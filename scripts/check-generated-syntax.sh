# Syntax/type-check both the hand-written harnesses and the generated query
# code under integration_tests/.
#
# Two different generators feed integration_tests/, and this script now
# checks the output of both:
#
#   - tools/integration-test-generator renders the per-project scaffolding
#     (test_integration.{php,rb,py}, main.go, *.csproj, Cargo.toml, ...) from
#     templates/*.jinja. A formatter once ran over those templates and
#     stripped their newlines, re-wrapping them as prose at 120 columns. That
#     silently produced harnesses with string literals split across lines and
#     `//` comments swallowing the code behind them, and it reached CI as a
#     pile of confusing compiler errors rather than as a clear signal.
#   - scythe itself renders the actual generated/ query code (queries.{ts,py,
#     rb,rbs,php,go,ex,cs}, src/queries.rs, src/main/{java,kotlin}/generated/
#     Queries.{java,kt}) from the SQL fixtures under integration_tests/. That
#     output was committed but checked by nothing: nothing in CI ever asked
#     whether 115 committed query files actually compile.
#
# Two shapes of check follow from that:
#
#   - Most languages check one file at a time, with no project context, using
#     whatever checker verifies syntax (and, where the checker is generous
#     enough to offer it for free, real symbol resolution against the JDK/
#     stdlib) without resolving third-party driver types. That is what `check`
#     below does.
#   - TypeScript, C# and Rust generated code references driver-specific types
#     (`postgres`, `Npgsql`, `sqlx::FromRow`, ...) that only exist once the
#     project's own dependencies are present, so a single-file check would
#     fail 100% of files on "cannot find module/type" -- a signal that is
#     uniform across every file and therefore says nothing about the
#     generator. `check_project` below runs one real build per project
#     directory instead: `pnpm install && tsc --noEmit`, `dotnet build`, or
#     `cargo check`, using the project's own committed lockfile. None of the
#     three needs a live database -- they are pure static checks -- but they
#     are real project builds, so they are slower and need network access to
#     restore packages the first time.
#
# In CI a missing checker must not silently no-op the guard it exists to
# provide, so strict mode turns a missing checker into a failure. Strict mode
# is on automatically when the CI env var is set (as GitHub Actions does), or
# explicitly via --strict. Local runs stay tolerant by default so a
# contributor without, say, PHP installed still gets useful output for the
# languages they do have.
#
# Strict mode also turns a pattern that matches zero files into a failure. A
# `check` with a zero-match glob would otherwise run its loop zero times,
# leave `failures` untouched, and report success identically to "every file
# parsed" -- so a harness or generator-output rename could silently disarm an
# entire language's coverage. Mirrors the `count -eq 0` guard in
# .github/workflows/ci.yml's provenance-header check.
#
# --harness-only skips every "(generated)" query-code check below and runs
# only the four scaffolding checks that predate this script's extension to
# cover generated/ query code. It exists for the `generated-freshness` CI job
# (.github/workflows/ci.yml), which installs only the toolchains those four
# checks need; the query-code checks need mvn/gradle/dotnet/rbs/pnpm/mix too,
# which is what the "Validate: Generated Query Code" job installs before
# running this script without the flag.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-generated-syntax.sh [--strict] [--harness-only]

  # TypeScript, C#, Rust, Java, Kotlin and Elixir generated code needs its
  # project's own dependencies resolved to mean anything, so these run one
  # real project build each instead of a per-file check.
  #
  # Java and Elixir specifically used to run through a bare javac/elixirc
  # per-file check here instead (no project, no dependencies). That
  # reported 11 failures that were not defects: javac has no classpath
  # entry for JSR-305 (`javax.annotation.{Nonnull,Nullable}`), which
  # tools/integration-test-generator/templates/pom.xml.jinja adds to every
  # committed java-jdbc-* project's pom.xml, and elixirc has no load path
  # for MyXQL/Tds, which is exactly what every committed elixir-*
  # project's `mix deps.get` provides. A real build tool run against the
  # real project reports what CI's `task test:*` would actually hit.
  #
  # Kotlin joined them for the same reason, one backend later. It ran
  # through a bare `kotlinc` per-file check justified by "generated Kotlin
  # only ever references java.sql/java.math/java.time (JDK-only) ... there
  # is no third-party classpath entry a real Gradle build would add that
  # bare kotlinc would miss". kotlin-r2dbc falsified that: its generated
  # code imports reactor.core.publisher.Mono, io.r2dbc.spi.Row and
  # kotlinx.coroutines.reactive, none of them JDK. Worse than a plain
  # miss, the failures were misleading -- with no io.r2dbc.spi.Row on the
  # classpath, `row.get("id", Int::class.javaObjectType)` resolved against
  # Kotlin stdlib's MatchGroupCollection.get and reported "actual type is
  # 'MatchGroup?'" on code that compiles cleanly under Gradle. A reason
  # that is true of every backend today is not true of the next one.

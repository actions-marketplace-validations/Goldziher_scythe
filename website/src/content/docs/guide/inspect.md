title: Inspect (live database)
description: Connect to a running database and run operational health checks with scythe inspect.
---

`scythe inspect` connects to a running database and runs a set of catalog
checks for operational issues that **only emerge in a live system** — foreign
keys without covering indexes, RLS misconfiguration, missing primary keys,
unlogged tables, sequences approaching overflow, and more. Stats-based checks
(unused indexes, slow queries) are not yet implemented — see the roadmap below.

It is the live counterpart to `scythe audit` (static rules) and `scythe lint`
(schema-aware static rules + sqruff). All three share the same `Finding`
shape, severity model, and reporter dispatch — output is human-readable text,
SARIF 2.1.0, or JSON.

## Quick start

```bash
# Default reporter (human-readable, grouped by file)
scythe inspect postgres://user:pass@localhost/mydb

# SARIF 2.1.0 for GitHub Actions code-scanning
scythe inspect "$DATABASE_URL" --format sarif --output report.sarif

# Print the check catalog and exit
scythe inspect --list-checks
```

The connection URL is resolved in order: positional argument →
`$DATABASE_URL` → `$SCYTHE_DATABASE_URL` → `[inspect].database_url` in
`scythe.toml`. If none is set, `scythe inspect` exits with a clear error.

## Check catalog

Scythe ships 13 PostgreSQL checks across three categories (`performance`, `security`,
`reliability`), plus 4 MySQL/MariaDB checks (`reliability`, `performance`) under the same
`--dialect mysql` / `--dialect mariadb` engine.

| ID | Name | Category | Severity | Detection |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-INS01 | missing-fk-index | performance | warn | Foreign-key columns with no covering index — every join through the constraint forces a sequential scan. |
| SC-INS02 | policy-exists-rls-disabled | security | error | Table has `CREATE POLICY` definitions but `ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is disabled — policies never apply. |
| SC-INS03 | duplicate-index | performance | warn | Two or more indexes on the same table have identical definitions modulo name — wasted writes and storage. |
| SC-INS04 | no-primary-key | reliability | warn | Ordinary table with no `PRIMARY KEY` — breaks logical replication and index-based joins. |
| SC-INS05 | rls-enabled-no-policy | security | warn | `ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is on but no policies exist — table is unreadable to non-owners (default-deny). |
| SC-INS06 | multiple-permissive-policies | performance | warn | Two or more `PERMISSIVE` policies for the same table/role/command — each adds an OR to every row filter. |
| SC-INS07 | security-definer-view | security | error | View not created with `security_invoker=true` — queries run with the view owner's permissions, bypassing RLS. Requires PG 15+. |
| SC-INS08 | function-search-path-mutable-live | security | error | `SECURITY DEFINER` function with no fixed `search_path` — vulnerable to search-path hijacking. |
| SC-INS09 | extension-in-public | security | warn | Extension installed in the `public` schema — widens search_path attack surface. |
| SC-INS10 | rls-disabled-in-public | security | warn | Table in `public` (default API exposure) with RLS disabled — any role with SELECT reads every row. |
| SC-INS11 | unlogged-table-in-prod | reliability | warn | `UNLOGGED` table — all data is discarded on crash or unclean shutdown. |
| SC-INS12 | partition-without-default | reliability | warn | Partitioned table has no `DEFAULT` partition — out-of-range inserts fail at runtime. |
| SC-INS13 | sequence-overflow-risk | reliability | warn | Sequence has consumed over 70% of its range — approaching overflow. |

SC-INS01–03 are clean-room reimplementations of the equivalent supabase/splinter lints (0001, 0006,
0009). See `ATTRIBUTIONS.md`.

### MySQL / MariaDB checks

MySQL and MariaDB share one driver and one check set — `SqlDialect::from_str` already normalizes
both spellings to the same dialect, and both engines carry the same relevant `information_schema`
columns. `--dialect mariadb` runs the identical `SC-INS-MY*` checks as `--dialect mysql`.

| ID | Name | Category | Severity | Detection |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SC-INS-MY01 | no-primary-key | reliability | warn | Ordinary `BASE TABLE` with no `PRIMARY KEY` — harms InnoDB row clustering and replication. |
| SC-INS-MY02 | duplicate-index | performance | warn | Two or more indexes on the same table cover the same columns in the same order — wasted writes and storage. |
| SC-INS-MY03 | auto-increment-overflow-risk | reliability | warn | An `AUTO_INCREMENT` column has consumed a large share of its type's range — approaching overflow. |
| SC-INS-MY04 | memory-engine-in-prod | reliability | warn | A table is on the `MEMORY` storage engine — all data is discarded on restart. |

MySQL/MariaDB has no equivalent of PostgreSQL's row-level security, extensions, or
`SECURITY DEFINER` search-path pinning, so those PostgreSQL-only checks have no MySQL counterpart.

## Severity and exit codes

`scythe inspect` follows the same exit-code convention as `scythe audit`:

- **0** — no findings, or no error-severity findings.
- **2** — at least one error-severity finding.
- **1** — runtime error (couldn't connect, query failed, bad config).

The `--exit-zero` flag forces exit 0 even when error-severity findings are
present, for advisory CI integration that publishes findings without
blocking a merge.

`--severity warn|error` drops findings below the given level before
emission. The default keeps everything.

## Engine support

`scythe inspect` supports PostgreSQL (and PostgreSQL-compatible engines like CockroachDB; see the
[`SqlDialect::from_str`](https://docs.rs/scythe-core/) mapping for the full list of accepted scheme
aliases) and MySQL/MariaDB. `--dialect postgres`/`postgresql` runs the 13 `SC-INS*` checks; `--dialect
mysql`/`mariadb` runs the 4 `SC-INS-MY*` checks — both engines share one driver and one check set,
since `SqlDialect::from_str` normalizes both spellings onto the same dialect.

Any other engine (SQLite, MSSQL, Snowflake, Oracle, Redshift) has no `scythe inspect` driver.
`scythe inspect --dialect <engine> --list-checks` for one of these prints:

```text
no checks available for engine `<engine>` — try `scythe inspect --list-checks` with --dialect postgres
```

and a live run reports the engine as unsupported rather than connecting.

## Project configuration (`[inspect]` in `scythe.toml`)

`scythe.toml` accepts an `[inspect]` section, mirroring the shape of
`[audit]`:

```toml
[inspect]
database_url = "postgres://localhost/dev"
api_schemas  = ["public", "api"]
extra_rules  = ["./inspect-rules.toml"]

[inspect.severity_overrides]
"SC-INS10" = "error"
"SC-INS13" = "off"

[[inspect.suppression]]
rule   = "SC-INS09"
schema = "public"
object = "pgtap"

[[inspect.check]]
id          = "USER-INS-001"
name        = "no-comments-on-tables"
category    = "schema"
severity    = "warn"
engines     = ["postgres"]
description = "tables must have COMMENT ON TABLE"
message     = "table `{schema_name}.{table_name}` has no COMMENT"
sql         = """
SELECT n.nspname AS schema_name, c.relname AS table_name
FROM pg_class c JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
WHERE c.relkind = 'r' AND n.nspname = 'app'
  AND obj_description(c.oid, 'pg_class') IS NULL
"""
```

- `database_url` — lowest-precedence URL source; see the resolution order
  above.
- `api_schemas` — schemas treated as the "API surface" for SC-INS10 (tables
  without RLS). Defaults to `["public"]` when empty.
- `extra_rules` — paths to additional check TOML files, resolved relative to
  `scythe.toml`.
- `[inspect.severity_overrides]` — per-check severity override keyed by
  check ID. Value is `"warn"`, `"error"`, or `"off"`; `"off"` removes the
  check from the active set.
- `[[inspect.suppression]]` — suppresses matching findings. A finding is
  suppressed when every `Some` field matches: `rule` (required), `schema`
  (matches a row binding whose name contains `"schema"`), `object` (matches
  a row binding whose name contains `"name"`).
- `[[inspect.check]]` — inline user-defined checks. IDs must be prefixed
  `USER-INS-`; every `{binding}` placeholder in `message` must exist as a
  column in the check's `sql`. Both are validated when `scythe.toml` loads.

`scythe inspect --explain <CHECK_ID>` prints a check's full rationale
without connecting to a database, for both canonical `SC-INS*` and
user-defined `USER-INS-*` checks.

## CI integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
name: scythe inspect

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  inspect:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:16-alpine
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: scythe
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: scythe
          POSTGRES_DB: scythe_ci
        ports: ["5432:5432"]
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
      - name: Apply schema
        run: PGPASSWORD=scythe psql -h localhost -U scythe -d scythe_ci -f schema.sql
      - name: Install scythe
        run: cargo install scythe-cli --locked
      - name: Inspect
        run: scythe inspect postgres://scythe:scythe@localhost/scythe_ci --format sarif --output inspect.sarif
      - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with: { sarif_file: inspect.sarif }
```

### Pre-commit hook (CI mode)

The published `scythe-inspect` pre-commit hook runs `scythe inspect` with no
positional URL argument, so it resolves the connection URL the same way the
CLI does: `$DATABASE_URL` → `$SCYTHE_DATABASE_URL` →
`[inspect].database_url` in `scythe.toml`. Runs where none of the three is
set fail loudly with the same error as the CLI.

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/scythe
  rev: v0.18.2
  hooks:
    - id: scythe-inspect
      # args: [--exit-zero]    # uncomment for advisory CI integration
```

Set `[inspect].database_url` in `scythe.toml` (see above) to make the hook
usable in ordinary local pre-commit runs, not just CI jobs that export
`$DATABASE_URL`.

## What `scythe inspect` does **not** do (yet)

`scythe inspect` is a per-invocation CLI command, not a daemon. It connects,
runs a fixed set of queries, prints findings, and exits. There is no
continuous monitoring, no historical state, no anomaly detection. For
those, point a real observability stack (pganalyze, Datadog, Prometheus +
postgres_exporter) at your database — `scythe inspect` is for the things you
can catch with a single catalog snapshot.

Also not implemented (by `scythe inspect` specifically):

- **Stats-based checks** (unused indexes via `pg_stat_user_indexes`, slow
  queries via `pg_stat_statements`, bloat via `pgstattuple`) — Phase 4.

:::note[Schema drift shipped, but in `scythe check`, not here]
Schema drift (declared `scythe.toml` catalog vs. live database) is implemented as of v0.14.0, as
`SC-DRF01`–`SC-DRF13` under [`scythe check --database-url`](/scythe/guide/cli-reference/#schema-drift),
not as a `scythe inspect` check. It reads `pg_catalog` the same way `scythe inspect`'s checks do, but
answers a different question ("does my committed schema still match the database?") than `scythe
inspect` does ("does my live database have an operational problem?").

## Phased roadmap

| Phase | Release | Theme | Engines | Checks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | v0.10.0 (shipped) | MVP — three Postgres checks | PG (MySQL stub) | SC-INS01..03 |
| **1** | v0.11.0 (shipped) | Full PG check pack + TOML rule registry + `--explain` + `[inspect]` config | PG | SC-INS04..13 |
| **2** | v0.14.0 (expanded in v0.18.0) | Schema drift — declared catalog vs live | PG | SC-DRF01..13 |
| **3** | shipped | MySQL/MariaDB driver + initial check pack | PG + MySQL/MariaDB | SC-INS-MY01..04 |
| **4** | not yet shipped | Stats-based — unused indexes, slow queries via `pg_stat_*` | PG | SC-INS-STAT01..04 |

Phases 0 through 3 are implemented; phase 2 landed as `scythe check --database-url` rather than as an
`inspect` check (see the note above). Phase 3 shipped with 4 checks, not the 6 originally scoped.
Phase 4 (stats-based checks) is not implemented.

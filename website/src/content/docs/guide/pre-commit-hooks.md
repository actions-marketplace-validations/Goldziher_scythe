description: pre-commit / prek hooks for SQL formatting, linting, code generation, and validation.
---

Scythe provides [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) / [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek)
hooks for SQL formatting, linting, code generation, and validation.

It also publishes the same six hooks as a native [Poly](https://github.com/xberg-io/poly) producer catalog.

## Setup

Add scythe to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/scythe
    rev: v0.18.2  # use the latest release tag
    hooks:
      - id: scythe-fmt
      - id: scythe-lint
      - id: scythe-audit
```

Then install the hooks:

```bash
# pre-commit
pre-commit install

# prek
prek install
```

## Native Poly Hooks

Add Scythe's producer catalog to the `[hooks]` configuration in `poly.toml`:

```toml
[[hooks.sources]]
id = "scythe"
git = "https://github.com/Goldziher/scythe.git"
revision = "v0.18.2"
hooks = ["scythe-fmt", "scythe-lint", "scythe-audit"]
```

Select only the hook IDs you want to enable. Poly rejects unknown IDs, and new hooks in later Scythe
releases remain disabled until you select them.

Choose whether this machine uses an existing Scythe binary or installs the pinned crate with Cargo.
Put this machine-local preference in the gitignored `poly.local.toml`:

```toml
[hook_preferences]
channels = ["system", "cargo"]
```

Poly tries channels in order. The `system` channel uses `scythe` from `PATH`. The `cargo` channel
installs the catalog's pinned `scythe-cli` version during `poly hooks install` and runs it from
Cargo's binary directory.

Resolve and lock the Git revision, commit the lock file, then install Poly's Git shims:

```bash
poly hooks update
git add poly.toml poly-hooks.lock
poly hooks install
```

Normal hook runs use the locked commit and do not move the configured revision. Change `revision`
and run `poly hooks update` when you intentionally upgrade Scythe. For local catalog development,
replace `git` and `revision` with `path = "../scythe"`; local sources reload on each run and do not
create a lock entry.

## Available Hooks

| Hook ID | Description | Modifies files | Requires config |
|---------|-------------|:--------------:|:---------------:|
| `scythe-fmt` | Format SQL files in-place | Yes | No |
| `scythe-lint` | Lint SQL files with auto-fix (includes audit rules) | Yes | No |
| `scythe-audit` | SC-SEC*/SC-RLS*/SC-MIG*/SC-CHK* security/migration audit | No | No |
| `scythe-inspect` | Live-DB health checks (SC-INS*) — needs `$DATABASE_URL` or `[inspect].database_url` | No | No |
| `scythe-generate` | Generate code from SQL schema and queries | Yes | Yes |
| `scythe-check` | Validate SQL without generating code | No | Yes |

### scythe-fmt

Formats SQL files using sqruff integration. Runs on changed `.sql` files and modifies them in-place
and exits 0 after writing. There is no exit-1 formatting failure to block the commit -- the commit is
blocked by pre-commit/prek's own detection that the hook modified files, the same mechanism that
blocks `scythe-lint`. Re-stage the changed files and commit again.

### scythe-lint

Lints SQL files and auto-fixes violations where possible. Runs `scythe lint --fix` by default. When run without a `scythe.toml`, only sqruff rules apply. With a config, both scythe rules (schema-aware) and sqruff rules run — and the canonical `SC-SEC*`, `SC-RLS*`, `SC-MIG*`, and `SC-CHK*` audit packs run too, dialect-gated by the `[[sql]].engine` field. A `mysql` project will not see postgres-only `SC-MIG*` findings; they're silently skipped.

### scythe-audit

Static SQL audit — runs the canonical security, RLS, migration-safety, and CHECK-integrity rule packs over staged `.sql` files. No `scythe.toml` or database connection required. Defaults to the `postgres` dialect; override via `args: [--dialect, mysql]` (or any other supported engine). Exits 2 when any error-severity rule fires; pass `--exit-zero` for advisory CI integration that publishes findings without blocking the commit.

### scythe-inspect

Connects to a live Postgres database and runs the `SC-INS*` operational health checks (missing FK indexes, RLS misconfig with policies, duplicate indexes). Resolves the connection URL the same way `scythe inspect` does: `$DATABASE_URL`, then `$SCYTHE_DATABASE_URL`, then `[inspect].database_url` in `scythe.toml` (see the [Inspect guide](/scythe/guide/inspect/)). Runs where none of the three is set fail loudly with the same error as the CLI. Designed for CI pre-merge gates and pre-deploy checks, not interactive commit blocking. Exits 2 on error-severity findings; pass `--exit-zero` via `args:` for advisory mode.

### scythe-generate

Regenerates code when `.sql` files or `scythe.toml` change. Requires a `scythe.toml` in the repository root. Generated files must be staged and re-committed if they change.

### scythe-check

Validates SQL schema and queries without generating code. Exits with code 2 if any error-severity
lint finding is present; exit 1 is reserved for operational failures (bad config, unreadable files).
Useful in CI or as a read-only validation step.

## Customization

Override default arguments in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Goldziher/scythe
    rev: v0.18.2
    hooks:
      # Format with a specific SQL dialect
      - id: scythe-fmt
        args: ["--dialect", "postgres"]

      # Use a custom config path
      - id: scythe-generate
        args: ["--config", "db/scythe.toml"]
```

:::caution[`scythe-lint` has no check-only mode via `args:`]
`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` bakes `--fix` into the hook's `entry` (`entry: scythe lint --fix`), not into
`args:`. Pre-commit's `args:` only *adds* arguments to `entry` -- it cannot remove `--fix` from it. So
`args: []` on `scythe-lint` still auto-fixes; there is currently no way to make the published
`scythe-lint` hook check-only without modifying files. Use `scythe-check` (which never writes files)
for a check-only step, or invoke `scythe lint` directly (without `--fix`) as a `language: system`
local hook.
:::

## Using a Pre-installed Binary

By default, hooks use `language: rust` which compiles scythe from source on first run. If you already have scythe installed (via `cargo install` or `brew`), use `language: system` for faster execution:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: scythe-fmt
        name: Format SQL (scythe)
        entry: scythe fmt
        language: system
        types: [sql]

      - id: scythe-lint
        name: Lint SQL (scythe)
        entry: scythe lint --fix
        language: system
        types: [sql]
```

## Recommended Combinations

**Most projects** -- format and lint SQL on every commit:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: scythe-fmt
  - id: scythe-lint
```

**Code generation projects** -- also regenerate code when SQL changes:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: scythe-fmt
  - id: scythe-lint
  - id: scythe-generate
```

**CI-only validation** -- check without modifying files:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: scythe-check
```

## Testing Hooks

Verify hooks work in your project:

```bash
# Test a specific hook on all files
prek run scythe-fmt --all-files

# Test with try-repo (no installation needed)
prek try-repo https://github.com/Goldziher/scythe scythe-fmt --all-files

# Dry run to preview what would execute
prek run scythe-lint --dry-run
```

## Notes

- **First run**: `language: rust` compiles scythe from source, which takes a few minutes. Subsequent runs use the cached binary. Use `language: system` to skip compilation if scythe is already installed.
- **Config path**: Hooks that require a config (`scythe-generate`, `scythe-check`) default to `scythe.toml` in the repository root. Override with `args: ["--config", "path/to/scythe.toml"]`.
- **Auto-staging**: When `scythe-fmt` or `scythe-lint --fix` modify files, pre-commit/prek reports the hook as failed. Stage the changes and commit again.
